                    A site to buy Bitcoin is called an exchange. There are many exchanges and the most famous being Coinbase, Kraken and Binance. Although these can be used if you already have an account, our advice is not to, because of the extreme high transaction costs ($30 USD).
                    <br>
                    Our recommended exchange is <a href="https://coinmetro.com" target="_blank">CoinMetro.com</a>, a cheap and trustworthy exchange. Below we explain how to register, get verified and buy Bitcoin with Credit/debit card or bank transfer.
