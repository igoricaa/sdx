                    At SmartDrugsX.com we value privacy and anonymity on the internet and we do everything to ensure the privacy and anonymity of our customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website address is: <a href="https://smartdrugsx.com">https://smartdrugsx.com</a>.

                    What personal data we collect and why we collect it.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">Orders</p>
                <p>
                    Orders will be shipped in discrete padded envelopes. The terms Modafinil or SmartDrugsX appear nowhere on the envelope. Also there will be no stickers or logos hinting at the contents of the envelope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since one of our payment methods is <b>Bitcoin</b> there will be no mention of SmartDrugsX on any transaction.
                    <br>
                    Due to the nature of the Bitcoin system the payment will be anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not share or sell customer information with third parties. Naturally the postal service will see the customer address, but will have no knowledge about the contents of the package.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website is fully secured via 256-bit SSL encryption and TLS 1.2. You can check this by clicking the padlock symbol next to our website address on the left and look for the phrase “SECURE CONNECTION”. This safety measure will make sure that a third party like your internet provider or authorities will not be able to follow your activities or orders and will make sure you will be able to perform secure payments.

                    We will not use your email address to send undesirable emails with continuous offers you do not want. If at some point we do send you an email there will be a possibility to unsubscribe from the emails.
