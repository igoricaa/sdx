                    Where you have purchased the goods or services as a consumer (i.e. for private use as opposed to business use), please note that you are entitled to cancel any contract completed with us within 7 days from the day after receipt of the goods or services (‘Cooling Off Period’).

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do cancel a contract within the Cooling Off Period, then:

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(a)</b> you must notify us by email and we will give you an RMA number and our return postal address;

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(b)</b> you must return the product to us within 28 days of receiving an RMA number from us;

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(c)</b> once we receive you return we will refund any amount paid to us (less postage costs) within 7 days;

                    <br>
                    We are unable to accept returns of products which have been opened as there is no way of that we can ensure that we can verify the contents of the product.

                    <br>
                    If you return goods to us for any other reason (for example, if you think the goods are faulty or damaged), then:

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(a)</b> you must notify us as soon as possible by email and we will give you an RMA number and our return postal address;

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(b)</b> you must return the product to us within 28 days of receiving an RMA number from us;

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(c)</b> we will examine the returned goods and if they are found to be faulty or damaged we will refund you the price of the faulty or damaged goods and will reimburse you for reasonable costs you have incurred in returning the goods.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>(d)</b> if the returned goods are not found to be faulty or damaged then we process this as a cancelled order.
