                    <li class="q">Why do I need Modafinil/Armodafinil products?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        These products are a game changer if you’re not getting enough sleep. Its primary effects include inducing wakefulness, mental alertness and cognitive enhancement.
                        <br><br>
                        Burning the midnight oil to get that project done? Modafinil or Armodafinil can very well be the sidekick you’re looking for. It is also used to help you stay awake during work hours if you have a work schedule that keeps you from having a normal sleep routine (Shift Work Sleep Disorder).
                        <br><br>

                        Modafinil and Armodafinil do not take the place of sleep, but it is what you need when the situation demands that you stay awake. These products work by altering the natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain.

                        No, using your own code for personal orders is not allowed. But you can use your earned commission as credit on any order, any time.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <li class="a">
                        <p>Modafinil and Armodafinil are legal and approved compounds. It is available over the counter at pharmacies around the globe on presentation of a valid prescription.</p>

                    <li class="q">What are the known benefits of Modafinil and Armodafinil?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>The effects of Modafinil and Armodafinil include:</p>
                        <p>▪Increased focus and mental acuity;</p>
                        <p>▪Wakefulness and alertness;</p>

                    <li class="q">What's the difference between Modafinil and Armodafinil?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>To put it is as simply as possible: Modafinil contains two enantiomers.</p>
                        <p>These are basically mirror images of the same molecule (similar to your left and right hands, for example) which have different reactions when ingested.</p>
                        <p>Only one of the enantiomers (known as the r-enantiomer) is important for cognitive stimulation, while the other type (known as the s-enantiomer) is thought to be useless Armodafinil consists only of the r-enantiomer (the one we love). Therefore, Armodafinil can be thought as a more concentrated form of Modafinil. However, it is important to note that the effects of both compounds vary from person to person, and some people prefer Modafinil to Armodafinil.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">Are Provigil, Nuvigil, Modalert and Waklert the same?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>These are some of the most popular Modafinil brands from around the world.</p>
                        <p>They essentially have the same chemical composition and similar effects, however prices may differ from brand to brand. Modalert by Sun Pharma is one of the best Modafinil brands available in the world.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">Sun Pharma vs Hab Pharma, what's the difference?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>The difference is the size and scale of the two manufacturers. Whereas Sun Pharma is a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical mammoth with manufacturing facilities all over the world, HAB is a smaller yet influential company with great promise.</p>
                        <p>Both of these manufacturer's products are extremely effective, nevertheless modafinil connoisseurs have their brand loyalty. We offer free samples of both products, so that you can determine which one suits you best.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">Whats dosages do you recomment for Modafinil and Armodafinil?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>Like many other medications, the human body develops tolerance to modafinil over time, which means you may need to increase the dosage over time to achieve a consistent effect. We recommend first time users to consume smallers doses by dividing the pills into halves.</p>
                        <p>We suggest starting with 100 mg doses and gradually increasing the dose if the need arises.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="q">What are the recommended consumption cycles for Modafinil and Armodafinil?</li>
                    <li class="a">
                        <p>Modafinil can be consumed as required, however to ensure that your body does not develop tolerance, do not consume Modafinil/Armodafinil for prolonged periods.</p>
                        <p>We recommend cyclical consumption, based on equal periods of use and avoidance.</p>
                        <p>For example: one week of use followed by a week without it. Please note that the human body requires sufficient sleep to function correctly and Modafinil/Armodafinil is not a substitute for sleep.</p>
